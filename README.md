# sorting-cinema
Animation of sorting and shuffling algorithms.
 This project is written in Pascal / Delphi language and runs under Windows 32 and 64 bit. It can be compiled from Delphi 4 til Delphi 7 without any problems or necessary changes, later / younger Delphis unknown. Sometimes, rather seldom the Delphi 7 compiler complains (warnings) the pointers (especially at first compilations after starting?), but it doesn't matter, the compilat(ion) runs nevertheless without any problems because of this.
