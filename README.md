# sorting-cinema
animation of sorting and shuffling algorithms
This project is written in Pascal / Delphi language and runs under Windows. It can be compiled from Delphi 4 til Delphi 7 without problems or necessary changes. Sometimes, rather seldom the Delphi 7 compiler complains the pointers (especially at first compilations after starting?), but it doesn't matter, the compilat(ion) runs nevertheless.
